A few facts about me on a professional and personal level

## A Little About Me
I'm a third year student at UCSD majoring in computer engineering. I'm interested in all sorts of applications of computer science and am currently looking into computer vision and digital signal processing. I'm from San Diego, California, and in my free time I like to read, bike, and play D&D. I most recently worked an internship at [BrainCorp](https://braincorp.com/) during the summer of 2022.
